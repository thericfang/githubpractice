# Interesting Takeaways
I found it pretty interesting that this Medium article tackles a problem in the tech jobs market. This article describes a very popular road to getting a software engineering job - going to a bootcamp. Unfortunately, those that graduate from these highly-intensive bootcamps lack some necessary fundamentals in computer science and find themselves not as successful as they want to be when they begin working. Many that graduate from these bootcamps are able to secure high-demand software engineering jobs, even if they are not necessarily the most suited or most experienced in their fields. However, bootcamps still remain super popular amongst high-school / college graduates that look to pivot their career choices.
